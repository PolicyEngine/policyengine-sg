# CPF Contribution Rates

## Overview
The Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates in Singapore are age-based and apply to employees earning more than S$750 monthly. Rates vary between Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents (PRs), and have specific provisions for the first two years of PR status.

## Current Contribution Rates (Effective from 1 January 2025)

### Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (from third year onwards)

| Age Group | Employer Rate | Employee Rate | Total Rate |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 55 and below | 17% | 20% | 37% |
| Above 55 to 60 | 15.5% | 17% | 32.5% |
| Above 60 to 65 | 12% | 11.5% | 23.5% |
| Above 65 to 70 | 9% | 7.5% | 16.5% |
| Above 70 | 7.5% | 5% | 12.5% |

### Key Rules and Provisions

1. **Age Milestone Changes**: Contribution rates change on the first day of the month after an employee's birthday milestone (55, 60, 65, 70).

2. **Minimum Wage Threshold**: Contribution rates apply to monthly wages above S$750. For wages between S$500 and S$750, employee contribution rates are gradually phased in while employer contribution rates remain the same.

3. **Permanent Residents (First Two Years)**: Different (lower) rates apply for Singapore Permanent Residents in their first two years of PR status.

4. **Total Wages**: Contributions are calculated based on Total Wages, which includes both Ordinary Wages and Additional Wages.
